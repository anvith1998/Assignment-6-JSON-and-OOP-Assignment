#Assignment 1
#ðŸ‘‰ 1. Create a JSON file (employee.json) containing employee information of minimum 5 employees. Each employee information consists of Name, DOB, Height, City, State. Write a python program that reads this information from the JSON file and saves the information into a list of objects of Employee class. Finally print the list of the Employee objects.

#Assignment 2
#Create a class named â€˜Dogâ€™. It should have a constructor which accepts its name, age and coat color. You must perform the following operations:

ðŸ”´ a. It should have a function â€˜description()â€™ which prints the name and age of the dog.
ðŸ”´ b. It should have a function â€˜get_info()â€™ which prints the coat color of the dog.
ðŸ”´ c. Create child classes â€˜JackRussellTerrierâ€™ and â€˜Bulldogâ€™ which is inherited from the class â€˜Dogâ€™. It should have at least two methods of its own.
ðŸ”´ d. Create objects and implement the above functionalities.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, coat_color):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.coat_color = coat_color

    def description(self):
        print("The dog's name is " + self.name + " and it is " + str(self.age) + " years old.")

    def get_info(self):
        print("The coat color of the dog is " + self.coat_color + ".")


class JackRussellTerrier(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age, coat_color):
        super().__init__(name, age, coat_color)

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof Woof!")

    def jump(self):
        print("The Jack Russell Terrier is jumping!")


class Bulldog(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age, coat_color):
        super().__init__(name, age, coat_color)

    def bark(self):
        print("Grrrr!")

    def sit(self):
        print("The Bulldog is sitting!")


# Creating objects
dog1 = Dog("Max", 5, "brown")
dog2 = JackRussellTerrier("Lucy", 2, "white")
dog3 = Bulldog("Buddy", 3, "black")

# Implementing functionalities
dog1.description()
dog1.get_info()
dog2.description()
dog2.get_info()
dog2.bark()
dog2.jump()
dog3.description()
dog3.get_info()
dog3.bark()
dog3.sit()
